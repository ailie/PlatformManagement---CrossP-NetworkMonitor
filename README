NetworkMonitor

A free, open-source and cross-platform network packet analyzer that can be used for network troubleshooting, analysis and education. NetworkMonitor also provides a sleek UI, Qt style.

Requires:
  * Qt SDK - http://qt.nokia.com/downloads;
  * pcap API - unix-like systems implement pcap in the libpcap library, while Windows uses a port of libpcap known as WinPcap.



# Warning

1. Check the file "NetworkMonitor.pro" and make sure exactly one OS section is un-commented, eg Windows if that's your OS.

2. In the requirements section above, it gets mentioned pcap "API" as in "application programming interface", so please do not try to compile and build this project using the "Driver + DLLs" WinPcap Installer (that may be needed on the end-user platform), instead download WinPcap "Developer's Pack" !

3. After downloading WinPcap "Developer's Pack", uncompress the archive in C: !



Have fun,
Andrei
